#### Why you picked the language you did ?
I have chosen PHP language because I am familiar with it and most of my experience is in this language.

#### What you wanted to accomplish with application ?
This small application displays hotel deals in an appealing manner by calling the rest API with certain query parameters.

#### What is Your thought process as you built the application ?
- Analyze the available rest API to understand the output format.
- Review the allowed query parameters to understand which param should be used for specific need and I do extra check on the params part to discover more params the API can support.
- Review Expedia site to understand how the data mapped and connected to each other so I can represent it correctly.

#### What you learned in the process. Mention how much (or little) experience you have with the particular language and framework you chose ?
- How to check ready rest API without full documentaion and try to find out the allowed params for the API to get data as much as I can.
- Understand the data and how its connected so I can represent it in the correct/best format.
- Walkthrough Expedia hotels, deals, search forms and listing products - Expedia orientation.
- How to use Heroku and trying to use Travis-CI if I have time.
- I have more than 10 years of experience in PHP in which two out of them were in Yii Framework.
